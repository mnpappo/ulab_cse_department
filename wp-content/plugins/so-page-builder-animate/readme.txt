Get Better Control over your Widgets. Easily show or hide WordPress widgets on specified pages & devices and/or assign custom alignment.

<h3>Notes:</h3>

If your theme already uses <a href="http://mynameismatthieu.com/WOW/">WOW.js</a> and <a href="https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/">animate.css</a> you need to 'dequeue' the following handlers in-order to prevent
conflicts:

In your theme functions.php add the following code:
<code>
<?php
add_action('wp_enqueue_scripts', 'dunhakdis_sbpa_remove_scripts', 100);

function dunhakdis_sbpa_remove_scripts()
{
	wp_dequeue_style('spba-animate');
	wp_dequeue_script('spba-wow');

	return;
}
?>
</code>
Thank you!
